Slap your MacBook, it yells back.

Uses the Apple Silicon accelerometer (Bosch BMI286 IMU via IOKit HID) to detect physical hits on your laptop and plays audio responses. Single binary, no dependencies.

## Requirements

- macOS on Apple Silicon (M2+)
- `sudo` (for IOKit HID accelerometer access)

## Install

Download from the [latest release](https://github.com/taigrr/spank/releases/latest).

Or build from source:

```bash
go install github.com/taigrr/spank@latest
```

## Usage

```bash
# Normal mode — says "ow!" when slapped
sudo spank

# Sexy mode — escalating responses based on slap frequency
sudo spank --sexy

# Halo mode — plays Halo death sounds when slapped
sudo spank --halo
```

### Modes

**Pain mode** (default): Randomly plays from 10 pain/protest audio clips when a slap is detected.

**Sexy mode** (`--sexy`): Tracks slaps within a rolling 5-minute window. The more you slap, the more intense the audio response. 60 levels of escalation.

**Halo mode** (`--halo`): Randomly plays from death sound effects from the Halo video game series when a slap is detected.

## How it works

1. Reads raw accelerometer data directly via IOKit HID (Apple SPU sensor)
2. Runs vibration detection (STA/LTA, CUSUM, kurtosis, peak/MAD)
3. When a significant impact is detected, plays an embedded MP3 response
4. 500ms cooldown between responses to prevent rapid-fire
